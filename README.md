# haskell-template

A Nix + Haskell template for Haskell projects. It includes useful
source code checks for Haskell (via `hlint`, `ormolu`, and
`cabal-fmt`) and Nix (`nixpkgs-fmt`).

To use this, for the most part you just need to look for instances of
`haskell-template` and replace it with the name of your Haskell
project. You'll probably want to rename the `haskell-template`
subdirectory, as well.

## License

The project's default license is BSD-3, but you may re-license this
project using any other license, at your discretion.
